# HTML-Text-Formatting

HTML Syntax: The language used to structure web pages is called HTML. It marks distinct elements with tags that are surrounded by greater-than and less-than symbols. HTML syntax efers to the set of rules that define how HTML documents should be composed. HTML syntax key aspects are: Tags, Elements, Attributes, Doctype Declaration, HTML Document structure, Comments, Charcter Entitles and Case Insensitivity. HTML syntax is straighforwward yet powerful, allowing developers to structure web pages effectively. Certain elements like paragraphs need to have both an opening and closing tags but others do not. HTML markup is used to give text meaning and make it easier fro computers to understand. The browser takes note of this structure and creates a large family tree that illustrates the connection between all the elements. In technical terms, it is referred to a DOM, tree. The significance of appropriate HTML structure is emphasized in the last paragraph. By employing ending tags like the closing </article> tag, developers mark the end of a given segment, in this case, an article with one title and three paragraphs. Anything inserted after the last </article> element will be viewed by the browser as being outside the article, even though it is still a part of the same HTML page. The organization of web documents is made clear and coherent by this commitment.

Paragraphs: Before the first paragraph, include an opening <p> tag, and at the conclusion, a closing </p> tag. Informing the browser that it is a distinct paragraph, this. Put the remaining paragraphs in their own <p> tags as well, so they still appear as one cohesive unit. We've provided the browser the correct instructions, so it can now identify these paragraphs as separate text segments.

Headlines: Headlines, subheadings, and titles are typically seen on web pages. With long texts, these components help break the text up into more manageable, smaller sections. They are essential in assisting users in understanding the organization of the website. Headlines take center stage on landing pages as the primary material. They serve as titles that readers can click to access further information. 

Bold and Italics: To represent this distinction in HTML, we have two unique components. Visual italics are applied using the "<i>" element, whereas emphasis is added using the "<em>" element. Despite having seemingly identical visuals, they have diverse functions. Here, semantic and human meaning are being communicated, not just fancy typography. The "<b>" element can be used to bold specific words without changing their meaning. This is helpful when we want a certain phrase to grab the reader's interest without having any particular meaning for the screen reader or browser. 

HTML Lists: We use list on a daily basis. We have desie lists, bucket lists, to-do lists, even lists in recipes.
