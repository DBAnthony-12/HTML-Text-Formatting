# HTML-Text-Formatting

HTML Syntax: The language used to structure web pages is called HTML. It marks distinct elements with tags that are surrounded by greater-than and less-than symbols. HTML syntax efers to the set of rules that define how HTML documents should be composed. HTML syntax key aspects are: Tags, Elements, Attributes, Doctype Declaration, HTML Document structure, Comments, Charcter Entitles and Case Insensitivity. HTML syntax is straighforwward yet powerful, allowing developers to structure web pages effectively. Certain elements like paragraphs need to have both an opening and closing tags but others do not. HTML markup is used to give text meaning and make it easier fro computers to understand. 

Paragraphs: Before the first paragraph, include an opening <p> tag, and at the conclusion, a closing </p> tag. Informing the browser that it is a distinct paragraph, this. Put the remaining paragraphs in their own <p> tags as well, so they still appear as one cohesive unit. We've provided the browser the correct instructions, so it can now identify these paragraphs as separate text segments.

Headlines: Headlines, subheadings, and titles are typically seen on web pages. With long texts, these components help break the text up into more manageable, smaller sections. They are essential in assisting users in understanding the organization of the website. Headlines take center stage on landing pages as the primary material. They serve as titles that readers can click to access further information. 

Bold and Italics: To represent this distinction in HTML, we have two unique components. Visual italics are applied using the "<i>" element, whereas emphasis is added using the "<em>" element. Despite having seemingly identical visuals, they have diverse functions. Here, semantic and human meaning are being communicated, not just fancy typography. The "<b>" element can be used to bold specific words without changing their meaning. This is helpful when we want a certain phrase to grab the reader's interest without having any particular meaning for the screen reader or browser. 

HTML Lists: We use list on a daily basis. We have desie lists, bucket lists, to-do lists, even lists in recipes. Unorded list, take a list of things which uses the <li> elemnet which represent an item. The <ol> list indicate that there is a specific order to the items on the list. TThe definition list is used when we wish to generate a list that looks like a key-value pair in computer science, as opposed to unordered or ordered lists with their list elements. In summary, there are three types of lists in HTML, unordered list, ordered list and definition list.

HTML QUOTES:Certain HTML components, such as paragraphs, unordered lists, and block quotations, are referred to be block-level elements. These components basically divide the page into distinct pieces. They can be viewed as independent entities that another block can come after. A portion of this has to do with CSS, where you can change an element's layout behavior from block to inline or the other way around. While some pieces represent the bigger organism itself, others act as identifiers for something that is a part of it. 

HTML DATE AND TIME INPUTS: HTML simplifies this by using a single element called <time> which is used to mark anything that specifies a time of day, date or duration. To format a specific momnet or range in time in a way that computers can understand, we use <time> element. The intriguing thing is that the text in between the tags, which appears on the website, can be written in any manner that is readable by humans. We must utilize the unique format that machines can comprehend for dates and timings. Highly uniforms formats are preferred by machine and the time element can aso be used to denote times.

HTML CODE, PRE AND BR: In HTML, The content is shown in a fixed-width font with formatting preserved by the <pre> tag. 
HTML BR: To force material onto the following line, insert line breaks using the <br> tag. 
HTML SUBSCRIPTS, SUPERSCRIPTS: For footnotes or mathematical notations, HTML has superscript (<sup>) and subscript (<sub>) tags that allow text to be shown above or below the baseline.
